This is a very simple web browser in PyQt to get info into and out of the Binder instance.

The code for it was taken from the [Learn PyQt](https://github.com/learnpyqt/15-minute-apps) repo, with small modifications to make it work for use case.

The icon `browser.png` was taken from the [Icon library](https://icon-library.com/icon/icon-brouser-1.html) webpage.
